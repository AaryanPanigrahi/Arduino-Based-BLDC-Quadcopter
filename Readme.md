# Arduino-Based-BLDC-Quadcopter (Phase 2 in progress)

A dual-stage drone development project evolving from a teenage challenge to a real-world Search & Rescue solution

---

### **Stage 1**
Started as a bored teenager wanting to tackle something difficult. Using scrap materials and a 3D-printed frame, attempted to build a drone on Arduino Uno because "the industry had it too easy."

**Reality Check:**
- Swollen LiPo batteries
- Multiple burned ESCs
- Drone development is NOT easy

And I paused the project due to lack of funding

### **Stage 2**
Renewed with actual engineering knowledge and passion for solving real problems

**Inspiration:** Thailand cave rescue incident sparked research into cave mapping applications

So I decide to research more probabable ideas and learn that one of my friend's dad's friend (long connection) distrubutes cave mapping software. This made me expand my scope to research more hybrid drone models, debating about imagining a bigger goal for the project

## Current Scope

Researching hybrid drone models capable of:
- **Amphibious deployment** for water-to-air transitions
- **Autonomous cave mapping** using SLAM technology
- **Real-time data transmission** even in minimum bandwidth areas
- **Search & Rescue operations** in confined spaces (potential)

## Technical Goals

- Water-deployable quadcopter
- Advanced flight controller integration (SpeedyBee F405)
- Onboard mapping and navigation systems
